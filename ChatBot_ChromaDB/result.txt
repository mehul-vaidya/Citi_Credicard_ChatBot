It ensures that all ingredients are evenly mixed on a low mixing speed, which helps to prevent food from burning or sticking to the bottom of the mixing bowl. NOTE Material damage from improper use. If the butterfly whisk comes into contact with the mixing knife or other accessories when the appliance is running, it could crack or break. •Ensure that the butterfly whisk is correctly attached to the mixing knife before setting the speed. •Do not exceed speed 4 when the butterfly whisk is fitted. •Do not use the spatula when the butterfly whisk is fitted. •Do not add any ingredients that could damage or block the butterfly whisk. HOW TO INSERT THE BUTTERFLY WHISK 1.Place the butterfly whisk onto the mixing knife and slightly turn it against the intended rotation of the mixing knife. 2.Make sure that the butterfly whisk is hooked into place and does not come off if pulled upwards. HOW TO REMOVE THE BUTTERFLY WHISK •Hold the ball-shaped end of the butterfly whisk and pull it out by gently rotating in both directions.Thermomix ® 23 5.5 SIMMERING BASKET The simmering basket is used for preparing more delicate dishes. It can also be used for filtering fruit or vegetable juices or as a sieve. When reducing liquids (e.g. sauces), the simmering basket can also be placed on the mixing bowl lid and used as a splash guard instead of the measuring cup. The simmering basket has a lid, which makes it even safer to use and prevents it from being overfilled. It is permanently attached to the basket and should not be removed at any time. HOW TO INSERT THE SIMMERING BASKET •Put the simmering basket into the mixing bowl. The hook for the spatula should point towards the handle on the mixing bowl. HOW TO REMOVE THE SIMMERING BASKET HAZARD Risk of scalding from hot contents. You could scald yourself on hot food in the simmering basket. •Use care when removing the simmering basket. •Ensure that the spatula is hooked securely onto the simmering basket before taking the simmering basket out. •Once you have put the simmering basket down, remove the spatula to prevent the simmering basket from tipping over. Use the spatula to remove the simmering basket. Proceed as follows: 1.Place the hook of the spatula into the notch of the simmering basket. Ensure that the hook is securely attached to the simmering basket. 2.Remove the simmering basket from the mixing bowl using the handle of the spatula. You can then transfer the simmering basket to the sink to allow any water to drain away. 3.Once you have put the simmering basket down, remove the spatula to prevent the simmering basket from tipping over.  The spatula is removed by releasing the hook from the notch. 5.6 VAROMA® The Varoma® is used for steaming food. The Varoma® consists of three parts: the Varoma® dish (bottom), the Varoma® tray (middle) and the Varoma® lid (top). This makes it possible to prepare several different components of a dish at the same time. The Varoma® can also be used without the Varoma® tray to steam larger items (e.g. dumplings) or prepare larger quantities. For instructions on using the Varoma®, see Steaming [ } 28].24 Familiarising Yourself with the Accessories Thermomix ® HAZARD Risk of scalding from hot steam. Steam is generated during cooking, particularly when using the Varoma®, which can scald you. •Keep away from the steam. •When preparing hot food, do not touch or cover the measuring cup. Make sure that the steam between the measuring cup and the opening in the mixing bowl lid can escape. •Ensure that some slots in the Varoma® dish and Varoma® tray remain free of food to allow the controlled escape of steam. •Ensure that the Varoma® dish is correctly positioned on the mixing bowl lid so that it does not tip and fall off. Do not place the Varoma® on the splash guard. •When removing the Varoma® from the mixing bowl lid and setting it aside, always keep the Varoma® lid on. •When removing the Varoma® lid, tilt the lid away from the face and body to avoid escaping steam. CAUTION Risk of burns from hot surfaces. When preparing hot food, the mixing bowl and the accessories that are used will also get hot. You could burn yourself on hot surfaces even after the heating process has finished. •Handle the mixing bowl, mixing knife and accessories with care, particularly during and after the preparation of hot food. •Only use the designated handles and grips when touching all components. •Allow the mixing bowl and the mixing knife to cool sufficiently before dismantling the mixing bowl and removing the mixing knife. NOTE Risk of damage from improper use of the Varoma®. Thermomix®  TM6 can get damaged if there is too little water in the mixing bowl. •Make sure that there is enough water in the mixing bowl. Approx. 250 ml of water will evaporate in 15 minutes in Thermomix®  TM6. •Top up the water if necessary, especially if you have subsequently increased the steaming time.Thermomix ® 25 5.7 SPLASH GUARD The splash guard is used to cover the mixing bowl when you are using very high temperatures in combination with oil, and steam needs to escape. Whenever the splash guard is required, you will see instructions on the display of your Thermomix®  TM6  telling you to cover the mixing bowl lid with the splash guard. HAZARD Risk of burns from hot fat. The High Temperature Mode heats fat. Water and oil mixtures may spit. You could burn yourself on the hot fat. •Never pour fat that has already been heated into the mixing bowl. •Never heat oil at High Temperature without other ingredients. If there is a delay in adding the ingredients, the hot fat will spit excessively. •Make sure that all Thermomix®  TM6 accessories used are dry. •Follow the instructions on the display. •Always place the splash guard correctly onto the mixing bowl lid as soon as your Thermomix®  TM6 instructs you to do so. •Ensure that the locking arms cover the splash guard.26 Operation Thermomix ® 6 OPERATION 6.1 SWITCHING ON AND OFF SWITCHING ON THERMOMIX®  TM6 •Press the selector. ðThermomix®  TM6  switches on and the default start page appears.
